Currently, I'm a software developer at [IBM Research](https://research.ibm.com/), working on AI for code and LLM evaluation.

I grew up in a [small town](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivarossa) in North Italy, and moved to NYC in 2014. 

I came to New York to study languages and music: I used to think that computers were just the boring machines I had to wrestle with to make my school presentations look half-decent. 

Things changed when I took an Intro to CS class on a whim. I still remember the spark I felt when I wrote my first program (a Python function to check whether any string is a palindrome): it turned out that I could tell these incredibly powerful machines _exactly_ what to do, and that thinking up clever things for them to do was a lot of fun. As I programmed more and mores, I realized something else: computers are incredibly empowering, and we can use them to build creative things and empower others.

I'm passionate about [free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html), jazz, and cats.
